# the-next-web-responsive-design
In this project, we'll build a responsive website by cloning <a href="http://thenextweb.com/">The Next Web</a>, a tech-focused magazine which uses media queries to gracefully degrade their site as the window size is reduced.

## Designed by:
<a href="https://github.com/ibrolive">Ibrahim Dauda</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Dongmo12">Armand Dongmo Tiakanang</a>
